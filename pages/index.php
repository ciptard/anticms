<?php $page_title = 'Home' ?>

<p>This is the home page. You can create other pages by adding PHP files to the pages directory. htaccess will
map pretty URLs to them. Use dashes between words in the filenames.</p>

<p>For example, if you create <code>contact-us.php</code>, it will be accessible from the path <code>/contact-us</code>.
